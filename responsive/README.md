Lab 4: Responsive Design

The media part of it worked perfectly. The images are switched at all switching points (every multiple of hundred pixels between and including 400 and 1200).
However, the images are not displayed in the correct order. The first image in each row is displayed correctly (in order), but the rest of the images are then displayed in reversed order.

So far, I have spent around 3 hours on this lab.
