COMP 20 Spring 2016 Private Repo for Mandip Pokharel

##Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of all the work I did as a student in Tufts' Web Programming class (COMP-20) with Ming.

## Work
This class was easily one of the more intense classes I took this semester, despite signing up not knowing how intense it would actually be.
However, it has also been a very great class. All the work I did, I did with a purpose. However, my learning in this class went beyond
programming for the web. While I feel that I have gained valuable fundamental knowledge of the web and programming for it, the most 
important part of this course was the non-technical parts. This class places a lot of emphasis on self-teaching oneself to go above and beyond
what is strictly required of you as a student. In a way, this class makes you more independent. But I feel that having taken this class
I feel more comfortable asking people for help. Which is a great thing -- something professionals do all the time.
For example, in implementing Facebook login for my group's semester project, I asked for help from my peerss in person and on Piazza, which 
certainly helped, but I was also able to use Google and Stack Overflow to use the API to suit my own needs. Similarly, that one time when
I was confident I had everything right, and just couldn't get my server going in assignment 3, and I asked Ming for help and he determined the
fault in my MongoDB connection in about 10 minutes, will always stick in my memories of how important it is to sometimes swallow your pride 
and ask for help.


My favorite work from this class was definitely Assignment 2 because it helped me realize exactly how interconnected servers are, and how
basic webpages make use of APIs to serve data and act dynamically. It was also a very infuriating lab because the simplest of error in latitude
vs. longitude ended up costing me about 5 hours of frustration.


Although I liked learning about it, I realized that back-end server side programming is not really my thing. I look forward to working more
with front-end design. I am looking into UI/UX and interface design and intend to take classes in the field!
