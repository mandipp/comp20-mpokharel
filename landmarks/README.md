#Assignment 2#
==================================
Two APIs were used in this project.
1. Google Maps
2. A Datastore JSON API

All the requirements as outlined in the assignment sheet have been met.
*Note: In virtual machine, the navigator.geolocation object shows my location as being about half a mile away from where my location actually is (as seen in Google maps in normal window)

Many thanks to Danish Bhatti from this class for his help in solving the landmarks problem via Piazza. Thanks also to Ming for the same reason.

Total time taken: ~12 hrs.
